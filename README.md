# IIIT Hyderabad - M.Tech-CSE (Spring 2023-24) 🌱

Hello! 👋

Welcome to the Spring 2024 semester at IIIT Hyderabad! This repository is a showcase of my academic journey throughout this semester, organized by subject. Each directory within this repository holds assignments, projects, and research that reflect the work done across various fascinating subjects.

## Repository Highlights 🗂️

### Statistical Methods in Artificial Intelligence 🧠

This course was a major focus this semester, immersing me in key areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Image Processing, and Neural Networks. The content here is divided into several parts:

- **Assignments 1-3:** These tasks establish a solid understanding of fundamental AI and ML techniques.
- **Mini Project (Assignment 4):** This project involved participating in a Kaggle competition, where I applied advanced AI concepts to address a real-world problem, integrating multiple domains of AI knowledge.

### Information Security and Audit Assurance 🔐

This subject extended my expertise into security practices and audit assurance, offering a broader perspective. The folder is organized into detailed sections, including:

- **Election Commission of India Simulation**
- **FELICITY Risk Assessment**
- **ISO 27001 Compliance**
- **Public Cloud Client Assurance**
- **Security Audit of Gateway**

Each section is rich with reports and exercises that focus on security audits, risk assessments, and the implementation of compliance standards.

### System and Network Security 🛡️

In this course, I explored the intricacies of system and network security. Although the professor's slides aren't included, the following key component is available:

- **Research Paper:** This paper was crafted after an in-depth analysis of a recent research study from an A* journal. It includes a review of significant related works and proposes new innovations inspired by the findings.

### Software Engineering 🧑‍💻

The Software Engineering course provided comprehensive insights into designing and developing high-quality software systems. This course emphasized the importance of modeling and refactoring in software development, introduced UML as a crucial tool for visualizing system architecture, and covered design principles and patterns that are essential for creating scalable and maintainable software.

One of the key learnings was identifying and addressing code smells, which are indicators of potential problems in the code that could affect long-term maintenance. Additionally, the course covered various architectural styles and patterns, such as event-driven architecture, which are vital for building robust and flexible software systems.

## Final Notes 🎓

The Spring 2024 semester at IIIT Hyderabad has been both challenging and rewarding. This repository is a collection of my contributions, and I hope it proves helpful to anyone delving into these subjects. Here’s to a productive and insightful M.Tech-CSE journey!
